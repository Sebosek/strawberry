# Strawberry

Just simple sample application how to work with HTML custom elements in ELM.

## How to
 - build `components`
 - copy `strawberry-components.js` and `strawberry-components` folder to `app\bin`
 - make an elm application as .js file with output to `bin` folder (hint. `elm make main.elm --output=bin\main.js`)
 - run dev HTTP server in `app`, I prefer `serve`
